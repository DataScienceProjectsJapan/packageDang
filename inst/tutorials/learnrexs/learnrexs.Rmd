### Exercise 15

## Advanced  

### Exercise 23

**HINT**:"spliting the mpg dataframe requires floor(), set.seed(), sample(), seq_len()"

```{r D23, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
half_size <- floor(0.5*nrow(mpg))
set.seed(123123)
mpg_half <- sample(seq_len(nrow(mpg)),size= half_size)

mpg_1 <- mpg[mpg_half, ]
mpg_2 <- mpg[-mpg_half, ]

ggplot(data= mpg_1) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x= displ, y = hwy))
ggplot(data=mpg_2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x= displ, y = hwy))
```

### Exercise 24

Write the R code for geom_point, and geom_smooth, with color=class, excluding all 2seater cars
```{r D24, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
   geom_point(data = filter(mpg, class != "2seater"), mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
   geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class != "2seater"), se= FALSE)
```

filter(flights, carrier == c("YV","HA","AS"))
```

### Exercise 26  
Refer to flights dataset.
Select all columns not containing the word "time"

```{r D26, exercise=TRUE}

flights$speed = flights$distance/flights$air_time
arrange(flights, desc(speed))
```

### Exercise 28   

Refer to flights dataset.
Rank the 10 fastest flights and 10 slowest flights  

```{r D28 hint}
# use top_n()
```


```{r D28, exercise=TRUE}

arrange(flights, desc(speed)) %>% top_n(10)
arrange(flights, speed) %>% top_n(10)
```

  filter(!is.na(dep_time)&!is.na(arr_time)) %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarise(first_dep = first(dep_time),
            last_arr = last(arr_time)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(first_dep,last_arr)) +
